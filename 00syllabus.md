## Prospectus

### Career Goals

- Be the second coming of Kazushige Goto-san 🙇🥷
- HPC 🏎️💨
- Modelling 🚂
- Scientific Computing 🧑‍🔬
- Compiler work 🛠️

### Personal Motivations

- Conquer the Math Dragon 🧮🐉: persistent nerves about doing higher level math need to be confronted with exposure therapy. Don't be fooled, math is half intuition cultivation and half a bag of tricks 🪄. It is learnable.
- Find Leverage: the longer I ignore the closed form solutions lurking in math the more pathetic my programming gets. δῶς μοι πᾶ στῶ καὶ τὰν γᾶν κινάσω 🌍🔧.
- Don't Get Bored 🥱: it's easy to get the gist of every subject halfway through a book but math always goes deeper. It won't be boring.

### Status

36M. Currently a successful developer working as a quasi-build and test engineer (CI/CD, testing, maintaining build systems, and writing auxiliary programs) for Onto Innovation's metrology business unit. Kind of a build and test engineer. More of a software mechanic with quick time to technical solution than a software developer with deep performance experience, but probably more knowledge about performance than the average developer. That is to say, I understand time complexity and op counting and what instruction pipelining is and memory latency, but haven't exactly spent time on avx intrinsics or assembly. Expertise in Python, experience in C, C++, C#, Rust, Java, and Javascript. Decent breadth of paradigm experience. 

No formal STEM background, more experience in literature, poetry, and classics. Majored in philosophy and classics with some specialization in logic and language:

- Phi of Lang
- Phi of Sci
- Phi of Mind
- Critical Thinking
- Symbolic Logic
- Modern Logic
- Aristotle's Logic
- Ancient Greek
- Latin

In my twenties I dipped into:

1. A random linear algebera textbook I never finished
2. Coding the Matrix (a linear algebra textbook) I never finished
3. A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics (which covers linear algebra like SVD) but I never finished
4. A random calculus book I never finished (I got bored during Integration)

But I'm tired of CI/CD. I want to do the real under the hood work. I also find higher math interesting and elegant despite my historical aversion to math in general.

### Philosophy

Seeking a basis for the goal space: linearly independent and yet still spans the goal space.

Seeking mathematical rigor to conquer the math dragon 🐉. No half assed computationally focussed "this is how you do a matrix multiply" books.

This booklist is meant to reflect the actual best and most rigorous texts that form the basis. MIT will have stuff like Strang, but I choose Axler. I choose Spivak for the disguised real analysis rather than a cookbook of derivatives. Soviet math is of particular interest for its reputation for blending intuition and rigor. Soviet books get ⚒️. 

No bridge books 🌉📚! LLMs solve the difficulty cold start wall problem. Sometimes I'll dip into supplemental works.

I am also interested in domain specific goals that can add dimensionality and give a real leg up in a particularly interesting domain (Durbin's BSA, Arnold's CM, Hecht etc.).

This syllabus is STRICTLY about the math and text books not about manuals and hands on work. That is all covered in parallel documents.

### Methodogy & Tools

Interleave 1-3 books at a time.

Anki helps to retain familiarity with definitions and challenging proofs encountered in work.

A Leuchtturm 1916 notebook contains a "Commonplace Book" of encountered proof tricks like "Completing the Square." The book will be refined with experience.

Also, work through the problems in a paper pad and nice notebook and also write them up in LaTeX. Solve the problems independently multiple times.

This process will take years. But every book completed should add to performance abilities at work. There won't be one day after completing this list where "Now you can work on HPC! 🧑‍🎓." Likely the list will be refined as the books are completed and you identify paths yourself rather than with help.

## Syllabus

### Progress Tracking

- Axler 01: 1 month ✔️
- Axler 02: 1 month ✔️
- Spivak 01: Started July 28, problem 18/25 on August 12
- Spivak 02: 8/13/2025
- Axler 03a: 8/14/2025

Certainly this is a slow ramp up and will accelerate.
